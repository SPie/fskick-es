  Returns a ranked list of `%Fskick.Players.PlayerStat{}` rows for every

  Derivations:
  - `points = wins * 3 / max(games, div(max_games_across_players, 2))`
  - `win_ratio = wins / games`
  - `games_ratio = games / total_games`

  A `:draw` outcome counts as a win for both teams (handled by the
  projector).

  ## Options

  - `:sort` — one of `#{inspect(@valid_sorts)}`. Defaults to `:points`.
    Sort is descending; `:games` is used as a tiebreaker. Players sharing
    the primary sort value share a position.
  - `:season_id` — when present, scopes the stats to a single season:
    rows come from `Fskick.Games.PlayerStats` filtered to that season,
    and `games_ratio` is `games / season_total_games`. When omitted,
    rows are aggregated across all seasons via `GROUP BY player_id` and
    `games_ratio` is `games / all_time_total_games`. Defaults to
    all-time.

  ## Options

  - `:sort` — one of `#{inspect(@valid_sorts)}`. Default `:points`. Same
    semantics as `list_player_stats/1`.
  - `:limit` — number of rows to return. Default `5`. The list is sorted by
    the chosen key first, then truncated — so changing `:sort` can change
    which players appear (matching the old Go app's `getFavoriteTeamOf5`
    behaviour).

  The `games_ratio` percentage uses the target's own total games as the
  denominator, so 100% means "always played together".
